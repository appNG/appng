== The appNG Maven Archetype
An appNG application uses https://maven.apache.org/[Apache Maven^] as a build system, thus the fastest way to setup an appNG application is to use the appNG Maven Archetype as shown below:
[source,subs="normal"]
----
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=mygroupid -DartifactId=myartifactid -DarchetypeGroupId=org.appng -DarchetypeArtifactId=appng-archetype-application -DarchetypeVersion={project-version} -DinteractiveMode=false
----

Using this archetype will result in the following `pom.xml`
[source,xml,subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
include::../listing/pom-archetype.xml[]
----

=== Using the appNGizer Maven plugin
The appNGizer Maven Plugin can be used to upload and install your application to several (local or remote) appNG instances.

By default, it binds to the `package` phase.

==== Goals

`upload` +
This goal uploads the application to a local repository, but does not install it.

`install` +
This goal uploads the application to a local repository and can also install it for a site. Optionally, this site can the be reloaded.


==== Configuration

General (default in braces):

* `endpoint` (`http://localhost:8080/appNGizer/`) +
the endpoint URL of appNGizer

* `sharedSecret` (_none_) +
the platform's shared secret to authenticate with

* `repository`  (`Local`) +
the name of the *local* repository

* `baseauthUser` (_none_) +
the user name for basic authentication

* `baseauthPassword` (_none_) +
the password for basic authentication

`install` goal only:

* `activate` (`false`) +
if the installed archive should be activated for the site

* `site` (_none_) +
the name of the site to reload after installing the application +
+
[NOTE]
====
In a local environment, you usually do not set up cluster communication. In order to make reloading sites with the appNGizer maven plugin work,
you have to set the site property `supportReloadFile` to `true`. The site reload will then be triggered by the existence of a marker file instead of a cluster event.

==== Example

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.appng.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>appng-appngizer-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${appNGVersion}</version>
    <configuration>
        <endpoint>http://localhost:8080/appNGizer/</endpoint>
        <sharedSecret>TheSecret</sharedSecret>
        <repository>Local</repository>
        <activate>true</activate>
        <site>manager</site>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>install</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>

=== Using the `local` profile
As an alternative deployment mechanism, you can use the `local` profile that builds an expanded version of your application directly into `${env.CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/ROOT/applications/`.

To make this work, these three preconditions must be fulfilled:

. The environment variable `CATALINA_HOME` must be set correctly.
. The application must have been installed through a local repository for at least one time.
. The platform property `filebasedDeployment` must be set to `true`.

[WARNING]
====
Note that changes in `application.xml` (`<roles>`, `<permissions>`, `<properties>`) do not get applied when using the `local` profile. You *must* deploy through a repository to apply these kind of changes.
====

You can even achieve to reload the site, as if using the appNGizer Maven Plugin (see above).

Therefore, set the site property `supportReloadFile` to `true` and let the `local` profile
create the required marker-file. This can be done by using the `maven-antrun-plugin` with a `<touch>` target:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
  <artifactId>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>1.8</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>run</goal>
      </goals>
      <phase>package</phase>
      <configuration>
        <target>
          <touch file="${env.CATALINA_HOME}/webapps/ROOT/repository/manager/.reload" /> <!--1-->
        </target>
      </configuration>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
----
<1> The path to the marker-file, where `manger` represents the name of the site to reload.
