== Caching

=== Platform configuration
Caching is provided by https://hazelcast.org/[Hazelcast^].

A central configuration file is used to configure Hazelcast. The location of this file is specified by the platform property `cacheConfig` 
(see {manager-guide}#platform-properties[Platform properties^]).

Usually, `cacheConfig` points to `WEB-INF/conf/hazelcast.xml`, which might look as follows for multicast replication:
[source, xml]
----
include::listing/hazelcast.xml[]
----

For further details about configuring Hazelcast, check out it's {hazelcast}[Reference Manual^].

Also check out the section about caching in the {manager-guide}#caching[Manager User Manual^].

=== Site configuration
There are several site-scoped properties to configure caching.

* `cacheEnabled` +
Set to `true` to enable caching for the site.
* `cacheExceptions` +
URL path prefixes which are never cached, as a multi-lined value. Contains one prefix per line. +
*Example:*
+
[source,]
----
/service/appng/my-application
/service/my-site
----
* `cacheTimeouts` +
The path specific cache timeouts, as a multi-lined value. The format is `path-prefix = TTL in seconds`. Contains one path-prefix per line. +
*Example:*
+
[source,]
----
/service/appng/cached-application = 7200
/service/thesite = 3600
----
* `cacheTimeoutsAntStyle` +
When set to `true`, the path-prefixes defined in `cacheTimeouts` can use https://ant.apache.org/manual/dirtasks.html#patterns[Ant-style path matching^].
* `cacheTimeToLive` +
The default TTL for a cache entry, if there's no matching path defined in `cacheTimeouts`.
* `cacheStatistics` +
Set to `true to` enable caching statistics
* `cacheWatchRepository` +
Set to `true` to watch the repository folder for changes and invalidate cache elements, if necessary.
* `cacheWatcherRuleSourceSuffix` +
The suffix to be removed from a `<from>`-rule element when parsing the rules from `urlrewrite.xml` for the repository watchers. See also the developerguide.html#beautifying-urls[Beautifying URLs^] section from the developer's guide,
* `cacheClearOnShutdown` +
Set to `true` to clear the cache on a site shutdown/reload.
