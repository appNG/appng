== Caching

Caching is provided by http://www.ehcache.org[Ehcache^].

A central configuration file is used to configure Ehcache. The location of this file is specified by the platform property `ehcacheConfig` 
(see {manager-guide}#platform-properties[Platform properties^]).

Also check out the section about caching in the {manager-guide}#caching[Manager User Manual^].

The site-scoped properties to configure caching are (see {manager-guide}#configuring-site-properties[Configuring site properties^] for details):

* `ehcacheEnabled`
* `ehcacheExceptions`
* `ehcacheBlockingTimeout`
* `ehcacheStatistics`
* `ehcacheClearOnShutdown`
