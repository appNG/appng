== Welcome to appNG
appNG is a *web application platform* and a *web application framework*, based on http://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache Tomcat^] and the https://spring.io[Spring Framework^].

With appNG, you can build your own applications and deploy them to the platform within minutes.

appNG is very well suited to create and operate your own application platform as a service (aPaaS).

== Core Features
* Clear separation of concerns following the *MVC* paradigm
* *Declarative UI definition* using schema-safe XML files
* Writing business logic by implementing a *handful of interfaces*
* Automatic *parameter-binding* and type conversion
* Built-in support for *paging, filtering sorting*
* Out-of-the-box support for *JPA* and http://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data^]
* Built-In *connection pooling* using https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP[HikariCP^]
* Database *schema migrations* powered by https://flywaydb.org[Flyway^]
* Built-In *role based access control*, which allows using field-based access
* Easily provide your own *SOAP* or *REST* based webservices
* Fully supports *internationalization* (i18n)
* *Easy deployment* by providing a repository mechanism
* Configurable caching powered by https://hazelcast.org[Hazelcast^]
* Cluster support and *horizontal scaling*
* Powerful *administration tools*, including a graphical user interface (GUI), but also a command line interface (CLI) and a REST-client
* Supports the *Bean Validation API*
* Supports *indexing and searching*, powered by http://lucene.apache.org/[Lucene^]
* Customizable *templating* mechanism
* Configurable and extendable *authentication mechanism* (local, LDAP etc.)
* Provides *job scheduling* powered by http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/[Quartz^]
* Provides *tooling for common tasks* like resizing images, sending emails, geo-locating, report generation etc.
* Provides a large set of commonly used *libraries* such as https://commons.apache.org[Apache Commons^] or https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson[Jackson^]
* *Workflow* and *business process management* support by embedding the https://camunda.org[Camunda BPMN Process Engine^]
* Can serve *JSP*-content that can make use of the appNG *tag library*
* *Multi-tenancy* allows to separate or group applications
* *Rapid protoyping* enables you to design your user interface without writing one line of Java code

== Getting started

[NOTE]
====
The dollar sign ($) at the beginning of a line denotes the command prompt. Depending on your operating system and shell you might see other signs like %, # or >. This sign is not part of the command to be executed.
====

=== Download and run the appNG standalone version
appNG is available as a standalone version, suitable for evaluation and testing purposes.

The standalone version also comes with *appNGizer*, the REST-based administration tool for appNG.

The standalone version can be found here:
https://appng.org/appng/builds/stable/appng-standalone-{stable}.zip

Check that Java >= 1.8 is available in your system's path:
----
$ java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_171"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_171-8u171-b11-1~bpo8+1-b11)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.171-b11, mixed mode)
----

Unzip the file, change into the extracted folder and run
[source,subs=normal]
----
./appng.sh
----

[NOTE]
====
When running under Windows, use `appng.bat`.
====

Wait a few seconds, until the console output stops, then visit http://localhost:8080/manager in your browser.

Sign-in with the username `admin` and the password `@ppNG$42`.

[NOTE]
====
On the first run, some unpacking and installation operations are performed, this my take a few seconds. The subsequent starts will be much faster.

If you accidentally misconfigured your appNG instance, you can force a clean re-installation with the `-i` option: +
`./appng.sh -i`
====

=== Download and run the appNG web-application version
If you run appNG in production you should use the web-application version, which is a standard web application archive (WAR-file).

Download the latest stable release from 
https://appng.org/appng/builds/stable/appng-application-{stable}.war

For further documentation on installing appNG go to the link:appng-application/README.adoc[README] of the appNG web-application.

=== Create your first appNG application
Using the *appNG Maven Archetype*, you can easily create your first own application.

Therefore, the following command must be used (replace `mygroupid` and `myartifactid` with the desired values):
[source,subs=normal]
----
$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=mygroupid -DartifactId=myartifactid -DarchetypeGroupId=org.appng -DarchetypeArtifactId=appng-archetype-application -DarchetypeVersion={stable} -DinteractiveMode=false
----

Next, change into the created project folder and run `mvn package`.

In the target folder, a file named `myartifactid-1.0-SNAPSHOT-<yyyyMMdd-HHmm>.zip` should have been generated.
This file is the application archive.

=== Deploying the application
The next step is to deploy the application through a local repository, e.g. the application archives are served from the local file system.

During installation of the *appNG standalone* version, a local repository has been created at `/path/to/appng-standalone-{stable}/repository/`.
So the first step is to copy `myartifactid-1.0-SNAPSHOT-<yyyyMMdd-HHmm>.zip` to this location.

[TIP]
====
You can also build the application archive directly in the repository folder by using the Maven option `-DoutFolder=/path/to/appng-standalone-{stable}/repository/`
====

Next, we use the *appNG CLI* to install the application and to activate it for the site `manager` (that has been created during installation).

In `/path/to/appng-standalone-{stable}/appng/WEB-INF/bin`, execute the following commands:

[source]
----
$ ./appng install-application -n myartifactid -v 1.0-SNAPSHOT -r Local
$ ./appng activate-application -s manager -a myartifactid
----

Both commands should return without any message, meaning they where successful.

[NOTE]
====
You can also use the appNG Manager or the appNGizer to install and activate an application. To see a list of available CLI commands, execute `./appng` or `./appng -h`.

If you configure the appNGizer Maven Plugin for your project, you can automatically install and activate your application after the build.
====

The final step is to __reload__ the site `manager`. Therefore, login at http://localhost:8080/manager and click on the reload-icon shown next to the site in the overview. A message __"Site has been reloaded."__ should appear.

After a re-login (see details below), a new navigation item named `MYAPPLICATION` should appear on the site's navigation on the left. When clicking it, you see the results of your very first appNG application. *Congratulations!*

[NOTE]
====
During installation, the application's role `Admin` has been added to the appNG's built-in `Administrators` group, to which your user belongs to.
Since the groups of a user are determined once during login, you need to re-login to apply the newly received permissions.

For the following updates of your application, this step is therefore not necessary.
====


=== What's next?
You should import the Maven project into your favorite IDE. Then start browsing the code to get an idea of how an appNG application works.
You should also take a look at the https://appng.org/appng/docs/{current}/reference/html/developerguide.html[Developer Guide].

You may also want to check out *appNGizer* at http://localhost:8080/appNGizer. The user manual can be found here:
https://appng.org/appng/docs/{current}/appngizer/html/appngizer-user-manual.html
