* Delete all folders from `$CATALINA_HOME/webapps`
* Expand `appng-application-{snapshot}.war` to `$CATALINA_HOME/webapps/ROOT`
* Create a new database with the DB management tool of your choice and set your database connection properties in the file
		`WEB-INF/conf/appNG.properties`
* Download Connector/J from here http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/ and save `mysql-connector-java-5.1.44.jar` to `$CATALINA_HOME/lib`
* Verify that `CATALINA_HOME` and `APPNG_HOME` in `WEB-INF/bin/appng` (for unix/linux based systems) or `WEB-INF/bin/appng.bat` (for windows based systems) match your local machine settings (change/uncomment the respective lines if necessary)
* in `WEB-INF/conf/install.list`
	** set the variable `ADMIN_SUBJECT` (#15) to your desired username
	
		def ADMIN_SUBJECT=johndoe
