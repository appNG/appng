/**
 * A {@link Consumer} is aware of several {@link Producer}s which can be added via the {@link #put(Object)},
 * {@link #put(Object, long)} and {@link #putWithTimeout(Object, long)} method. It can access it's queued
 * {@link Producer}s with the corresponding {@link #get()}, {@link #get(long)} and {@link #getBlockingQueue()}

 * TODO MM this has nothing to do especially with searching! Design seems overloaded, use a shared single BlockingQueue
