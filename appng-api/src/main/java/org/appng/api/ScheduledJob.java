/**
 * 
 * A {@link ScheduledJob} is a (periodically or manually triggered) task that can be defined by an {@link Application}.
 * The job's {@code jobDataMap} can contain any information that the job needs to be executed. For periodical execution,
 * there are two pre-defined entries for the {@code jobDataMap}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code cronExpression}<br/>
 * A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#CRON_expression">cron-expression</a> describing when the
 * {@link ScheduledJob} should be executed.
 * <li>{@code enabled}<br/>
 * If set to {@code true} and the {@code cronExpression} property is present (and valid), the {@link ScheduledJob} will
 * automatically be scheduled when the platform starts.
 * <li>{@code runOnce}<br/>
 * If set to {@code true}, this job will only run once per cluster, i.e. it is not executed on each node, which is the
 * default behavior.
 * <li>{@code hardInterruptable}<br/>
 * If set to {@code true}, this job can safely be interrupted, e.g when a {@link Site} is being reloaded. This is
 * achieved by running the job in a separate thread and calling {@link Thread#interrupt()}.
 * <li>{@code allowConcurrentExecutions}<br/>
 * If set to {@code true}, multiple instances of this job can run concurrently (default is {@code false}).
 * </ul>
