 * If a {@link Application} want's to authorize a domain object to several {@link Role}s, the domain-object needs to
 * implement {@link Authorizable}.<br/>
 * The {@link Role}s provided by the {@link Application} can be obtained by calling {@link Application#getRoles()}. Since
 * the {@link Role}s are maintained by appNG and not by the {@link Application} itself, the {@link Authorizable} just
 * needs to maintain the IDs of the authorized {@link Role}s.<br/>
 * When using JPA for persisting domain objects, this can easily be done by using a
